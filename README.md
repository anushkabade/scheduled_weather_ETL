Design and implement a Python-based ETL pipeline that fetches weather data for multiple cities from a public API, performs transformations and validations, and stores the results in MongoDB using an efficient schema. Produce daily summary reports (min/avg/max temperature per city) to support downstream analysis.
 Learning Objectives
- Build a scheduled data ingestion job for multiple sources (cities).
- Apply transformations, validation, and deduplication before storage.
- Design indexes and collections to support analytical queries.
- Implement MongoDB aggregation pipelines for summary insights.

 Tools and Technologies
- Python 3
- MongoDB
- pymongo
- requests
- APScheduler (optional scheduling)
- OpenWeatherMap API
